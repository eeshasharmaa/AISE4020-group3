# AISE4020-group3

This project aims to be a tool used in chemical plants to alarm supervisors and workers if a fire is about to start. Ideally, it will use values from various transponders located around a chemical reactor as data inputs and predict later temperatures using a time-series algoritm. Based on the temperatures predicted, those values will be tested using a flammability limit test which finds the upper and lower limits of volume percentage of XXX per volume of air. 

For the purposes of this project, the dataset being used will be from a smoke detector.
