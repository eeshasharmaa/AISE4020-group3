# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np  # For numerical operations
import pandas as pd  # For data manipulation

# Load the dataset
# Ensure the CSV file is in the correct directory or provide the full path
myData = pd.read_csv("smoke_detection_iot.csv")  # Replace with the actual file path if needed

# myData is now a DataFrame containing sensor readings (e.g., temperature, humidity, gas levels)
