# Flammability Equations:
# These equations adjust the Lower and Upper Flammability Limits (LFL and UFL) 
# based on temperature changes. This helps determine the risk of fire hazards 
# in varying environmental conditions.

# LFLt (Lower Flammability Limit at temperature T)
# UFLt (Upper Flammability Limit at temperature T)
# LFL25, UFL25: Flammability limits at 25°C (standard reference)
# dH: Enthalpy change (heat of combustion, energy needed for ignition)
# T: Temperature in °C

LFLt = LFL25 + (0.75 / dH) * (T - 25)  # Adjusted LFL based on temperature variation
UFLt = UFL25 + (0.75 / dH) * (T - 25)  # Adjusted UFL based on temperature variation
